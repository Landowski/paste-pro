        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>At Paste Pro, we respect your privacy and are committed to handling your data securely and transparently. Our app allows you to create, save, and manage text snippets securely using Firebase (Google’s infrastructure) for authentication and data storage. Below, we detail how your data is processed.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>When you use Paste Pro, your text snippets and account information are stored securely in Firebase, Google’s backend service. This includes account details (email, username if applicable) for authentication; your saved text snippets, stored in Firebase’s secure database; usage data (e.g., timestamps, device info) to improve functionality.</p>

        <p>Unlike traditional cloud storage, Firebase provides encrypted data storage with Google’s security infrastructure, ensuring your information remains protected.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>Your data is stored with high-security standards using Firebase’s infrastructure, which includes:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS) for all data transfers.</li>
        <li>Google’s authentication protocols (Firebase Auth) for secure login.</li>
        <li>Database access controls to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
        <li>Regular security updates from Google’s Firebase team.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We do not store your data on separate servers—everything is managed through Firebase under Google’s security policies.</p>

        <h2>Use of Cookies & Analytics</h2>
        <p>We use cookies and Firebase Analytics to improve your experience by tracking app performance and user interactions (anonymously); enhancing app functionality and troubleshooting issues; personalizing features based on usage patterns.</p>

        <p>These tools do not access the actual content of your saved snippets unless explicitly required for support (with your permission).</p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>Your snippets and account data remain private and are not shared with third parties except: Google Firebase, as the infrastructure provider (subject to Google’s Privacy Policy) and legal requirements, if mandated by law (e.g., court orders).
        
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or monetize your data.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You can delete your account (and all associated data) at any time. For questions or data requests, contact us at <b>landowskiapps@gmail.com</b>.</p>
