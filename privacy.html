        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>At Paste PRO, we respect your privacy and are committed to treating your data securely and transparently. Our tool allows you to create and save text snippets in the cloud, using Google's database, Firebase. Below, we detail how data is treated, especially in relation to registration, login and use of Firebase.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>We only collect data necessary for account authentication and use, such as your email address. Your snippets and other settings will be saved in Firebase, a cloud database platform that allows you to synchronize your data between different devices. This process ensures that your notes are accessible anywhere as long as you log in.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>Firebase takes advanced security measures to protect stored data, including encryption and authentication. Furthermore, we only use the data strictly necessary to guarantee the functionality of the app, such as your registration email.</p>
 
        <h2>Cookies Policy</h2>
        <p>Our website does not use cookies to track your activities or collect personal information. However, when using Firebase for authentication and data storage, session cookies may be used to ensure that your login is maintained while you navigate through the site. These cookies are essential for the service to function and are not used for marketing or advertising purposes.</p>
 
        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>Data saved in Firebase is protected and not shared with third parties except when required by law. We only use Firebase to store and synchronize your data, guaranteeing your privacy.</p>
 
        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information stored on Firebase. If you wish to remove your account and all associated data, please contact us and we will take the necessary steps.</p>
        
        <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy periodically to reflect changes to our services or applicable regulations. Any changes will be published on this page. We recommend that you review this policy regularly to be aware of any changes.</p>
