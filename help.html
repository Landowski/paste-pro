        <h2>Operation Problem</h2>
        <p>After registering and inserting your shortcuts, the extension should work normally, both for typing shortcuts and for the right-click menu. If it doesn't work, first make sure you have logged into the app. If you are logged in and it still isn't working for any reason (which isn't normal), follow the steps below and it will fix it.</p>

        <span style="margin-bottom: 7px;"><strong>1. In the browser, at the top right, click the puzzle icon:</strong></span>

        <p></p>

        <span style="margin-bottom: 7px;"><strong>2. Click "Manage Extensions":</strong></span>

        <p></p>

        <span style="margin-bottom: 7px;"><strong>3. Then turn the extension off and on again:</strong></span>

        <p>Furthermore, after installing the extension, it is necessary to reload the pages that are already open to receive the extension signal.</p>

        <h2>How to use Airtext</h2>
        <p>Well-designed shortcuts can increase productivity and ensure consistency, while poorly designed shortcuts can lead to errors and inefficiency. This guide will help you create shortcuts that work seamlessly, making your digital workflow faster and easier.</p>

        <h2>How to Create Good Shortcuts for a Text Expander</h2>
        <p>Creating useful shortcuts requires some thought. Here are some key factors to consider when designing shortcuts that are quick to type and prevent unexpected errors.</p>

        <h2>1. Length Matters: Short Shortcuts Versus Long Shortcuts</h2>
        <p>Although short shortcuts are faster to type, they can sometimes lead to accidental expansions. For example, if you set "tks" to expand to "Thank you very much," typing will be fast, but you might accidentally use "tks" in the middle of a sentence where you didn't want the expansion.</p>

        <p>Rule of thumb: find a balance. Use shortcuts that are short enough to be convenient but unique enough to avoid accidental triggers. If a shortcut is too short, consider adding an extra letter or character to make it more unique (such as "--tks" or "@tks" instead of "tks").</p>

        <h2>2. Start or end shortcuts with a special character</h2>
        <p>Ending your shortcuts with a special character, such as a period, comma, or slash, is a great way to avoid conflicts. If your shortcut is “addr-,” for example, you're unlikely to accidentally type that string in everyday writing, making it a safe choice. Adding a special character signals the text expander that the shortcut is complete, so there's less chance of it accidentally replacing text.</p>

        Example:
        <br/><br/>
        <p>
        • <strong>Incorrect shortcut:</strong> "home" for your home address (can be expanded whenever you type "home" in a sentence)
        <br/>
        • <strong>Good shortcut:</strong> "home//" ou "//home"
        </p>

        By adding a unique starting or ending character, you make the shortcut more precise and avoid unnecessary expansions. You'll quickly get used to typing these endings, and your workflow will be smoother as you avoid accidental expansions.</p>

        <h2>3. How to remember your shortcuts</h2>
        <p>Once you've created effective shortcuts, the next challenge is remembering them. Here are some ways to keep track:</p>
        <p>
        • <strong>Group by category:</strong> Consider grouping shortcuts by category and using similar patterns. For example, all email-related shortcuts can end in “@” (like “work@” for your work email) and all address-related shortcuts can end with a hyphen (“home-”). Alternatively, use Airtext categories to better organize your shortcuts.
        <br/>
        • <strong>Maintain consistency:</strong> If you have a specific style, such as always ending shortcuts with a special character, it will be easier to remember shortcuts when they follow the same pattern.
        <br/>
        • <strong>Practice Regularly:</strong> Practice typing your shortcuts to build muscle memory. The more you use them, the more natural they will look.
        <br/>
        • <strong>Use the context menu:</strong> Airtext has a menu that is activated by right-clicking on the text fields where you want to insert the shortcut. Just select the "Airtext" option in this menu, and it will show all your shortcuts (including categories) ordered by title and the command for the shortcut itself.
        <br/>
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Creating efficient shortcuts in a text expander is a simple yet powerful way to save time and speed up your typing. By using shortcuts long enough to avoid accidental triggers and starting or ending them with a special character, you can ensure accuracy and avoid interruptions in your work. With some initial setup and consistent use, your shortcuts will quickly become second nature, increasing your productivity and making your digital life easier.</p>
